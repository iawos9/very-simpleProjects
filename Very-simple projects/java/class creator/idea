At the university, I see a schedule for like some practical labs for physics or whatever is that subject, it was created in excel

I just thought if I can create a java app to make auto-schedule for these practical labs

the idea for creating auto labs is still complicated for me,  I mean its gonna create a list of random labs name without duplicated
